        <h2>Reason's why you did not get a response to your private message</h2>
        <p>I have a lot of people who message me and ask questions that are easy to find or it should common sense. 
        </p>
        <h3>for example messages like</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Q: How to pair PS4 controller to my PS3 A: <a href="https://youtu.be/jrgA6Hr8DFo">YouTube Tutorial</a></li>
            <li>Q: This mod menu doesnt work for me A: Have you tried checking that you are in the highest resolution or atleast in 720p as mod developers target HD Resolutions. do not contact me unless its a  mod i created otherwise put a message in a discord server like mine (others may be able to help you) or in the creator's discord if there still around. or in the showcase's comments if you found it on youtube</li>
            <li>
                Q: HELP ME MAKE MOD FOR PS3 
                A: NO this is a complex area (I struggle with explaining things in a DM and i get lot of these) please watch some youtube tutorials, read github repos and try to recreate and explain of thats doing, or even read the SDK manuels 
                (this how ive done it most of the time) <br>
                also if this is your first coding project i recommend not doing this and starting to make programs in a program like python or javascript to learn the fundementals. i have studied on my course we used a website called <a href="https://www.py4e.com/">Python for Everyone</a> then you can lead back to GTA V Mod Creation</li>
            <li>Q: Send me link for X game A: That is Piracy. i cannot support piracy as its against tos on many platforms or in rare cases ill meme and send a link to a digital storefront like ebay/steam/ps store/xbox marketplace/eshop</li>
            <li>Q: How do i install X mod menu. A: Majority of mod menus on PS3 are installed by placing .sprx file and if there is a folder in /dev_hdd0/tmp/ and the eboot will go in /dev_hdd0/game/(GAMEID)/USRDIR. usually they will have a read me which will describe on how to install it or a section on the website which will show you how to install.</li>
            <li>Speaking another language or broken looking english A: The languages i can speak is English (英語) and a tiny bit of Japanese (日本語) but i would prefer if you could speak to me in english if you could</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I'm sorry had to come to this. im just getting so many messages that about these things that should be able for people google or search a tutorial on. 
            I geniunly do love helping people but i do other stuff outside of modding that also I should have focus on. ill most likely respond in a discord server if im not busy
